Of course. It's crucial that documentation reflects the reality of the code. Let's update that original plan to be a perfect description of the robust API we've built.

Here is the revised and accurate documentation for the Collections API, based on our current codebase.

Collections API Documentation (Final Implementation)

Excellent. Based on the code we have successfully built, here is the updated and accurate documentation that reflects the final implementation.

Plan Overview

Our goal was to create a self-contained system for managing "Collections" without altering the existing Products system. We have achieved this by defining a flexible data structure in MongoDB, creating a suite of API endpoints for both public and admin use, and implementing robust business logic.

Step 1: Data Model / Mongoose Schema (Final Implementation)

This is the foundation. Instead of a traditional relational "pivot table," we leveraged MongoDB's strengths by embedding the product relationships directly within the Collection document. This is more efficient for our use case.

A. Collections Schema

This Mongoose schema stores the core information and the associated products for each collection.

Field Name	Data Type	Notes
_id	ObjectId	Primary Key for the collection, auto-generated by MongoDB.
title	String	English title (e.g., "Popular Products"). Required.
title_bn	String	Bangla title (e.g., "জনপ্রিয় পণ্য"). Required.
description	String	English description. Optional.
description_bn	String	Bangla description. Optional.
url	String	A unique, URL-friendly "slug" (e.g., popular-products). Must be unique.
lucide_react_icon	String	The name of the icon for the frontend (e.g., "Flame", "Star").
priority	Number	For ordering collections themselves. 1 is highest priority.
is_active	Boolean	A flag to quickly enable or disable the collection.
start_date	Date	The start time for visibility. Can be null.
end_date	Date	The end time for visibility. Can be null.
products	Array	An embedded array of objects linking to products. (See below)
createdAt	Date	Auto-generated timestamp by Mongoose.
updatedAt	Date	Auto-generated timestamp by Mongoose.

B. Embedded products Array Structure

This is the crucial part that links Collections and Products. Each object in the products array has the following structure:

Field Name	Data Type	Notes
product	ObjectId	A reference to an _id in the products collection.
priority	Number	The display order of this product inside this specific collection. 1 is the first product shown.

Why this structure is perfect:

No change to Products: We never modify the original products schema or collection.

Efficient Reads: A single query fetches a collection and all its associated product references, which can then be populated.

Contextual Priority: A product can have a priority of 1 in "Flash Sale" but a priority of 10 in "Popular Products," as this is stored in the embedded object.

Step 2: API Endpoints (Final Implementation)

We have designed a RESTful API with a clear separation between public-facing and admin-only routes.

A. Public Endpoint

Endpoint: GET /collections

Action: Returns a list of all collections that are currently active for public viewing. The logic filters based on is_active: true and the current date being within the collection's start_date and end_date. Collections and the products within them are sorted by priority.

B. Admin Endpoints

All admin routes are protected by JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard (requiring an ADMIN role) and are prefixed with /collections/admin.

Create a Collection

Endpoint: POST /collections/admin

Action: Creates a new collection.

Request Body: A JSON object with collection details and an array of products, each with a productId and a priority.

Read Collections (Admin View)

Endpoint (List): GET /collections/admin

Action: Returns a list of all collections, regardless of active status or dates.

Endpoint (Single): GET /collections/admin/{id}

Action: Returns the full details of a single collection, with product details populated.

Update a Collection (Partial)

Endpoint: PATCH /collections/admin/{id}

Action: Updates an existing collection. You only need to send the fields you want to change (e.g., title, is_active, start_date). If a products array is included, it will completely replace the existing list of products for that collection.

NEW: Add Products to a Collection

Endpoint: POST /collections/admin/{id}/products

Action: Adds one or more new products to an existing collection without affecting the products already there. This is the preferred way to add products after a collection is created.

Request Body: {"products": [{"productId": "...", "priority": ...}]}

Delete a Collection

Endpoint: DELETE /collections/admin/{id}

Action: Permanently deletes a collection from the database.

Step 3: Business Logic & Validation Rules

The API is intelligent and enforces the following rules:

Authentication: All /admin endpoints are protected and accessible only by authenticated users with an "admin" role.

Validation:

title, title_bn, and url are required for creation.

The url must be unique across all collections. A ConflictException (409) is thrown if a duplicate is attempted.

All productIds provided in any request are validated against the Products collection to ensure they exist. A BadRequestException (400) is thrown for invalid IDs.

The POST /admin/{id}/products endpoint prevents adding a product that is already in the collection.

Public Visibility Logic: The public GET /collections endpoint contains specific logic to only return collections that should be visible right now, respecting the is_active flag and the start_date/end_date window.
